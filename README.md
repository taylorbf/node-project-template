# Node Module Project Template

**Author:** Ben Taylor

**Overview:** A place to start when making a JS module using gulp and browserify

## How to use

Download this template and type `npm install` in terminal in the project folder. 

Then run `gulp` to compile and create a dist. Notice that `gulp` creates a few new folders including `/dist` with the compiled library, and `/api` with an API website built with JSDoc3. The API is compiled from comments in the JS.
